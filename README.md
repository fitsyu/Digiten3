A gesture based 3D tennis game where you swing your smartphone imagining your self handling real tennis racket to play the game

why 3?
well my first try when starting development of this game was using raw OpenGL.

seconds is when I realized that the machine learning lib that employed in the game has to be compiled by C++11.

third (this) is where now I use system wide IPC. (D-Bus) to communicate between components. 

that would make things complex even more. 

But we got bigger place to play here.

the game now can be written in any language as long as it supports D-Bus.
